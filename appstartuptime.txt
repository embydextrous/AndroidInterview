Cold Start - From Scratch < 5
1. Load and Launch App
2. Display Blank Window After Launch
3. Create App Process
4. Create App Object
5. Launch Main Thread
6. Create Main Activity
7. Inflate Views
8. Laying Out Screen
9. Perform Initial Draw

Warm Start < 2

1. Activity is recreated.
2. Process is recreated (due to eviction by OS from memory) but benefits from saved instance

Hot Start < 1.5
1. Activity onStart

Common Reasons
1. Heavy App Init
2. Heavy Activity Init - complex layouts, blocking ops like network or DISK I/O, Loading and decoding bitmaps, Rasterizing VectorDrawable, other inits
3. Custom Splashscreens

Solutions

1. Lazyify Dagger Dependencies
2. Single Content Provider for SDK Inits - Using App Startup Library
3. Async Loading of Branding Image
4. Simplify launch screen layout
5. PNG to WebP

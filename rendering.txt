Surface Flinger - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5699107/android-surfaceflinger (Composites all surfaces to construct final frame to be rendered and passes it to HAL where HWC does further optimizations)
VSync - https://medium.com/@kiitvishal89/vsyncs-or-vertical-sync-never-heard-of-it-or-did-you-edc055a0decd
VSYNC is vertical sync. Its a term common to TVs, monitors, displays, etc. You can basically think of it as the refresh rate, its how often the display is
actually refreshed. The display can only update on the VSYNC signal, so changes to the display are basically batched until the next VSYNC.
Display List
Choreographer - DoFrame -> from UI to render thread
invalidate() - hey I need to redraw myself
requestLayout() - hey I need to be measured and layout again
View - Interactive UI Element
Surface - Hold pixels that are composited on screen. Every window has a surface.
Canvas - locked surface to perform View.onDraw()
Window - A rectangle on screen having its own surface. WManager renders window according to z index order. Each window has single view hierarchy.
HWC (Hardware Compositor) - Performs reordering and other optimizations
Frame Buffer and Back Buffer - Frame buffer holds current screen content, back buffer holds next frame content
Bitmap - An interface to pixels which may or may not be owned by it. (For ex. canvas hooking up to surface which actually owns pixels)
